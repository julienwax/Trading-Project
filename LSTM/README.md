# LSTM Forecasting
This folder contains the initial attempts to implement a proper LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series forecasting.

# Key Features
Some scripts utilize OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) features for forecasting, while others incorporate Volume and various indicators.
This folder includes previous versions that demonstrate prediction errors, such as plots with a large Mean Squared Error (MSE).
# Objectives
Similar to the ARIMA folder, the goal here is to establish a benchmark for results that can be compared with those from the ARIMA forecasting.
# Note
This folder contains extensive information, some of which may be repetitive. Readers may prefer to consult the Trading Bot folder for more concise insights.
