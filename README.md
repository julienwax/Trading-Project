# Algorithmic Trading Project
This algorithmic trading project is still under development.

# Key Features
LSTM Models: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting.
Implemented Strategies: Includes various trading strategies that have been set up.
Trading Bot: A bot that executes the trading strategies.
# Backtesting
Backtests are available for all implemented strategies, using data downloaded via Interactive Brokers.
# Requirements
Interactive Brokers Account: To utilize the script for downloading data, an Interactive Brokers account (at least a demo account) is required.
API Setup: You may need to change the socket port or IP address to configure the API correctly.
# Additional Data Sources
Some code segments also uses data from Yahoo Finance, which do not have specific execution requirements.

Some scripts may include drafts or older components that have been saved to optimize the newer strategies.

# The Trading Bot folder is the most relevant and up-to-date resource if you would like to focus on more concise results.

# Following Developments
I am currently specializing in futures contracts on indices and plan to develop a strategy using market depth data, footprint data, and intermarket relationships.

To achieve this, I am observing patterns with my Sierra Chart Trading Workstation, which I designed to identify these patterns.

My focus is primarily on the CME Group, specifically the E-Mini S&P 500, E-Mini NASDAQ (NQ), Russell 2000, and Dow Jones indices.
