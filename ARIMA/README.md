# Time Series Prediction with ARIMA
This folder focuses on time series prediction using ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models.

# Project Objectives
The primary aim of this project was to implement an ARIMA-based forecasting strategy with optimized parameters, serving as a benchmark for subsequent work with the LSTM model.
Results from the ARIMA model were compared to findings from a Stanford paper, establishing a foundational reference for the project.
